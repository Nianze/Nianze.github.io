# Education

- **New York University**
| Master of Music - _Music Technology_
- **Cornell University**
| Master of Engineering - _Electrical and Computer Engineering_
- **Southeast University**
| Bachelor of Engineering - _Electronic Science & Technology_

I still remember the excitement when I saw Microsoft Kinect being able to detecte human skeleton, which made me decide to take advantage of this interesting hardware to build a [robot](https://youtu.be/Y7ey0uSVP0o), or specifically a vending-machine-like robot with kinect as its eyes. Teamed up with two of my classmates, we took part in the China National Kinect for Windows Application Development Contest, in which we've got 1st prize among all 151 teams selected nationwide. We also took the robot to Microsoft Imagine Cup, where we've got 2nd prize.

With my knowledge of computer increased, I found more fun in programming, largely due to its faster feedback loop during development compared to hardware design. So after publishing a paper on [Nanoscale-DOI:10.1039/C4NR06883A](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/nr/c4nr06883a#!divAbstract) (thanks to which I received Microsoft Research - IEEE Young Fellow Scholarship), I decided to learn more about coding. I graduated with honors in 2015 and obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering from **Southeast University**. Shortly after that, I went to **Cornell University** for my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

After spending three years playing the clarinet in school concert band and recording music covers with clarinet during leisure time, I realized very few things in this world could touch my soul so directly like music. Not satisfied with only transcribing favorite music pieces into clarinet versions and recording them myself, I started to explore more genres of music, to actively look for music production opportunities, and to coordinate with others in events such as Ludum Dare Game Jam. Therefore, when I came to know the music technology program in **NYU Steinhardt**, it suddenly made my mind clear that this would be a perfect match of what I am looking for: to integrate both my favorite means of creativity, the tech and the music, together to create something greater than I could imagine. Thus, after working as a full-time software developer in Bloomberg L.P. for about two years, I started my second part-time master degree in music technology.

# Hobbies

## Music

I started playing the clarinet since my elementary school and joint school concert band during my high school. Music has become a pleasing way of self-expression. After covering some of my favorite songs in clarinet during the summer of 2015, I determined to make it one step further: why not to write my own music? So I started to practice with piano, guitar and launchpad, only in hope of making my own sound. Check out my channels:

## Photography

I received my first DSLR (a brand new Pentax K5 with 18-55 kit lens) as a gift from my mom in the summer vacation of my fresh year, and become interested in taking photos since then. I do street photography most of the time since I live in cities. My current gears:

* iPhone X (mostly used one)
* Leica M9
* Leica Summicron-M 35mm f/2 ASPH
* ZEISS C Sonnar T* 50mm f/1.5 ZM
* ZEISS Biogon T* 21mm f/2.8 ZM
* Sony A7 (1st generation) with Voigtlander VM-E Close Focus Adapter for VM-Mount Lens to Sony E-Mount Camera
* LightPix Labs FlashQ Q20II
