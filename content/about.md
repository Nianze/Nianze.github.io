## Education

**New York University**
| Master of Music - Music Technology

**Cornell University**
| Master of Engineer - Electrical and Computer Engineering

**Southeast University**
| Bachelor of Engineer - Electronic Science & Technology

Computer always fascinates me. I chose Electronic Science & Technology as my undergrad major largely because I want to better understand the basic of computer hardware. 

Among all those hardwares I've played with, I still remember the excitement I firstly saw Microsoft kinect being able to detecte human skeleton, which made me decide to take advantage of this interesting hardware to build a [robot](https://youtu.be/Y7ey0uSVP0o), or specifically a vending-machine-like robot with kinect as its eyes. Teamed up with two of my classmates, we took part in the China National Kinect for Windows Application Development Contest, in which we've got 1st prize among all 151 teams selected nationwide. We also took the robot to Microsoft Imagine Cup, where we've got 2nd prize.

With my knowledge of computer science increased, I've realized that programming is an increasingly powerful skill nowadays. So after publishing a paper on [Nanoscale-DOI:10.1039/C4NR06883A](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/nr/c4nr06883a#!divAbstract) (thanks to which I received Microsoft Research - IEEE Young Fellow Scholarship), I decided to hone my coding skills. I graduated with honors in 2015 and obtained my Bachelor's degree of Engineering from **Southeast University**. Shortly after, I went to **Cornell University** for my master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

My undergrad coursework included:

* Algorithm
* Circuit & Electronic Circuit
* Computer Architecture & Logic Design
* Advanced Mathematical Analysis

* Machine Learning for Data Science
* High Level Digital Design Automation
* Intro to Database Systems
* Intro to Computer Graphics
* Intro to Computer Music

## Hobbies

### Music

I started learning the clarinet since my elementary school and joint school concert band since junior high. Music has become a pleasing way of self-expression. After covering some of my favorite songs in clarinet during the summer of 2015, I determined to make it one step further: why not to write my own music? So I started to practice with piano, guitar and launchpad, only in hope of making my own sound. Everytime I feel tired of practicing, listening to songs from Ed Sheeran, 米津玄師 and 40㍍P will always vitalize myself again.

Recently my music list includes such genres like Jazz, Electronic and JPop. Check out my music channels:

* [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/2844586/)

### Photography

I've received my first DSLR (Pentax K5) as a gift at the summer vacation of my fresh year, and have fallen in love with photography since then. I like street photography as well as landscape, only taking portraits occasionally. Check out my photos:
