东风夜放花千树，更吹落、星如雨。  
宝马雕车香满路。凤箫声动，玉壶光转，一夜鱼龙舞。

This music is from [Spirited Away](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/) (千と千尋の神隠し), which is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by [Studio Ghibli](http://www.ghibli.jp/). The melody is peaceful and elegant, which is written by Youmi Kimura (木村 弓), a Japanese singer and lyre performer.

Actually, I choose this one because this is chosen as the library's closing-door music when I'm a undergrad. 

Everytime the music is on, we know it is 10:00pm and it is time to go back to dorm. At that time I always prefer to stay as late as possible in the library until the guard cruising around to drive me away. If the assignment is still not yet finished and deadline is approaching, I might even decided to go to the lab building around,  finishing the remaining part. 

Sometimes when I stepping out of the library building, the [Big Dipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper) lied right ahead of me on the sky, and I would wear my headphones, turn on the music, and ride my bycicle back to the dorm. On the way, thinking about everything, past and future, I could only felt the wind.

And all those days are spirited away:
