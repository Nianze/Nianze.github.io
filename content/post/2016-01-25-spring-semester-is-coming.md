As the new semester approaches, I finished two more clarinet covers

## Hello especially

The music is from ED of
[Silver Spoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spoon_(manga)), which 
is full of pastorale and optimism. Every time
I hear the song, I recall the happy daily life of Yuugo Hachiken in his
agricultural school. May you also enjoy this happiness as I do.

## つないだ手

Another ED from Fullmetal Alchemist FA, also from Japanese manga artist
[Hiromu Arakawa(荒川 弘)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiromu_Arakawa). Below
is her self-portray of bespectacled cow.

I have to say Hiromi's manga is always my type. I can find an optimism from
every person in her manga, which makes me think about the good side of life.

And then you'll know that: 

>Take it easy, and all is well.
