### Why I launched the clarinet cover project

In the summer of 2015, I started recording my clarinet cover inspired by [ShonHayashi](https://www.youtube.com/user/linnaes) when I accidentally found his Youtube channel. At that time, actually, I haven't touched my clarinet for a long time, partially due to my old opinion that clarinet is such a classical instrument that it is never a good fit for performing mordern style music.

And I changed my opinion since I heard ShonHayashi's clarinet cover on Vocaloid then.

> "Whoa! He plays the clarinet so well, why not to have a try muself just like him?"

In my mind, clarinet is not as expressive as violin or piano: the voice character of clarinet feels like silk, so it is hard to handle music with too strong emotions - maybe that's why it is hard to see clarinet in Rock music :). However, it's worth a try for music with elegant and sweet styles. Especially a good fit to imitate human voice[^1].

So, since I happen to know how to play this instrument, why not to have fun with it, and play some music that once touched me?

### My early covers in summer of 2015

At that moment, I did not know how to transcribe a sheet on my own, so I simply picked some of my favorite covers from ShonHayashi. All of these clarinet sheets below are transcribed by [him](https://www.youtube.com/user/linnaes).
