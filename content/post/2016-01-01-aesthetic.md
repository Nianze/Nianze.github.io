My new year's first cover is for Hiroyuki Sawano!

## Another beautiful piece from [Hiroyuki Sawano](http://www.sawanohiroyuki.com/)

I have to admit that I'm a big fan of Hiroyuki Sawano. Every time I listen to his music, my heart is always filled with strength. 

This *Aesthetic* is from his original album [Musica](http://www.sawanohiroyuki.com/works-original.html) released in 2009-07-15.

### Aesthetic 

{{< youtube niKDxuHvPfY >}}


Longing for you day and in dream
盼望著你白天與夜夢中

I'm hoping you are here and leading my way
我期盼你在身邊牽引著我向前

You steers my road anytime I need
你總在我需要時引領著我

If you walk away，I will follow you
如果你離開了，我將會跟隨著你

Trying my life with your sacred gifts you gave to me
盡我一生攜帶直著你贈予我的神聖禮物

I won't vain and succeed it as your precious soul
我向你高貴的靈魂看齊即使功成名就也不驕傲自負

Holding your hand
緊握著你的手

And I'm walking through the all of the world
在黯淡的天空中

Carrying your wish like the Venus in the dim sky
緊擁著你如金星般閃耀的夢想將足跡遍佈整個世界
