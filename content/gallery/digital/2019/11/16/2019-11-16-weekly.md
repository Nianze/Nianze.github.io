# The excerpt
>The point is, a great deal of our limited supply of attention is committed to the tasks of surviving from one day to the next. Over an entire lifetime, the amount of attention left over for learning a symbolic domain—such as music or physics—is a fraction of this already small amount.   
Excerpt From: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. "Creativity."
