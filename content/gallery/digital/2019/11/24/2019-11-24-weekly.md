# The excerpt
>I have always looked upon the task of a scientist as bearing the responsibility for persuading his contemporaries of the cogency and validity of his thinking. He isnâ€™t entitled to a warm reception. He has to earn it, whether by the skill of his exposition, the novelty of his ideas, or what.   
Excerpt From: George Stigler
