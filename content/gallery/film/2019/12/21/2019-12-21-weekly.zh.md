# The excerpt
>When we intend to solve a problem consciously, we process information in a linear, logical fashion. But when ideas call to each other on their own, without our leading them down a straight and narrow path, unexpected combinations may come into being.   
Excerpt From: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. "Creativity."
